# ANN(Artifical Neural Network)
An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection,
like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons.
An artificial neuron that receives a signal then processes it and can signal neurons connected to it. 
The "signal" at a connection is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. 
# Aim
To perform ANN in data set to find the output which is in classifed form
# Data
Data ia about a person activity like RowNumber,	CustomerId	,Surname	,CreditScore,	Geography	,Gender,	Age,	Tenure,	Balance,	NumOfProducts,	
HasCrCard,	IsActiveMember	,EstimatedSalary	,Exited(labeled 0 or 1 ).downloaded from kaggle which is about 1000 rows.
# Information
all the features are in number , except geography and gender which is further converted into number using dummies variable
# Procedure
